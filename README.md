# New in Titanium SDK 3.3.0

This repo contains examples of a handful of the many new things in Titanium SDK 3.3.0.

## AppCompat

The AppCompat library brings the ActionBar to devices running Android 2.3.x.  Find examples of a plain App that you can run on old emulator/devices, and an example of an app using custom ActionBar Styles.

## Widget Themes

Before Alloy 1.4 there was not easy way of changing the styling of widgets.  This new feature allows you to add a widget folder to your themes folder to change the styling of your widgets based on the theme selected for your build.

## TSS Device Queries

This new feature in Alloy 1.4 allows you to create your own, user-defigitned properties to be used in TSS and XML tags.  Typically you can do ```platform="ios"```, but you couldn't say ```platform="ios7"```.  With this feature you can create your own check for iOS 7 and then say [if=Alloy.Globals.isIOS7].
